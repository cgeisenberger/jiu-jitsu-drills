### Guard Retention

* open guard, uke stands and tries to get angle
  - space available: scoot away, change angle
  - uke close: get shin-on-shin
* open guard, uke steps inside with lead leg
  - frame on leg or scoot out
  - better: get shin-on-shin
* anywhere between sitting & flat on back, uke passing with leg control
  - redirect head, scoot away
  - (maybe plus Granby???)
* knee slice pass
  - get "double hooks"
  - RDLR + butterfly hook on same leg
* flat on back, uke smash passes with underhook
  - foot on hip & push (shrimp out aswell)
